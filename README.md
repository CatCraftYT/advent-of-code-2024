# Haskell Advent of Code 2024
My solutions to Advent of Code 2024, all in Haskell. This was one of the first projects I wrote in Haskell, so it's probably not the cleanest/fastest code. Not all problems are solved at the moment, and the given solutions are what I used to solve each problem for the first time, unoptimized.

# Running
This project has the following dependencies:
```
base >= 9.2.8
extra >= 1.7.16
regex-tdfa >= 1.3.2.2
unordered-containers >= 0.2.20
```

Build with `make` then run any of the outputs. The day's input should be in the directory `inputs` with the name `day(x).txt`

# Unsolved
- Day 12 (part 2)
- Day 16
- Day 17 (part 2)
- Day 19
- Day 20 (part 2)
- Day 21
- Day 23 (part 2)
- Day 24 (part 2)
